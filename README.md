# Sortablz

Sortablz is a plugin that adds the functionality of dynamically sorting elements to a WordPress page.

## Plugin Features
Sortablz is a jQuery based plugin that uses the shortcode [SORTABLZ] to load on only the page you want items sorted. Put the Shortcode anywhere on a WordPress page or post, and the javascript component will load after the page.

After the page loads, the plugin initially scans the page for sortable items (generally divs) and sort-by data about how to sort them. It determines which toggle is checked and sorts them. The plugin does not scan the page again, it saves sorting and sort-by data and simply re-orders them when a toggle is clicked.
